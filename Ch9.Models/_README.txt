Assembly to hold the Model classes to be used by all UI (View and ViewModels) and Service layer objects.

Model object (de)serialization and model object configuration (to be able to use in the Ui) are done in the Service layer. 

No dependencies allowed in this assembly. 


(Please note that the Data access layer does not use any models, only primitives and JSON strings)
